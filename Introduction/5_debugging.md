# Chapter 5 - Debugging

Let's imagine you're building a Lego castle, but sometimes pieces don't fit together, and you want to avoid that. Here's how you can make sure your Lego castle doesn't have problems:

- Use appropriate data types and structures (make sure the pieces fit): Just like selecting the right Lego pieces, choose the correct data types and structures for your software.

- Utilize code reviews and static analysis tools: Similar to asking a friend to check your Lego castle, have others review your code. Code reviews and automatated tools  (like linters and static analyzer) can help identify mistakes you might overlook, such as incorrect logic or potential security vulnerabilities.

- Implement early error detection (catch mistake quickly): If something in your code isn't working as expected, address it immediately instead of moving forward. Use assertions, logging or exceptions to make errors apparent as soon as they occur. This "fail fast" approach prevents small issues from snowballing into larger problems.

- Perform thorough testing: After coding, rigoously test your software. Run unit tests, integration tests and system tests to ensure everything works correctly.

If an issue is discovered during testing and after deployment:

- Isolate the issue (find the problem): Focus on pinpointing the exact source of the problem. Narrow down the bug to a specific module, function, or even a line of code. This isolation makes it easier to address the issue without disrupting other parts of the software.

- Analyze the root cause (think about why it happened): Investigate why the bug occurred. Was it dued to an incorrect algorithm, a misunderstanding of requirements, or a missed edge case? Understanding the root cause is key to implementing a proper fix.

- Apply the fix (fix it): Correct the issue by adjusting the code. This might involve correcting logic errors, optimizing algorithms, or handling edge cases properly. Ensure the fix addresses the problem without introducing new issues.
- Document and learn (remember the problem): Document the issue, how it was identified, and how it was fixed. This helps in learning from the mistake and preventing similar issues in the future. It also aids other team members in understanding the context of the change.
